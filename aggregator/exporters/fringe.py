Export a list of websites that are on the fringe in a feed network.

That is, if you are using the cluster spider, this exporter will export the list
of websites that are not crawled due to the spider hitting the depth limit
â€” the outermost nodes.

(In graph terms, this exporter exports all vertices whose indegree is 1.)

Note that websites that are on the "fringe" because they were filtered out
by the domain filter (instead of hitting the depth limit) will also be included
here. To only export sites under a certain domain, use ~+f domain under ...~,
to exclude a certain domain, use ~-f domain under ...~.
